# 🧩 **Browser Extension Security Audit & Threat Removal**

### 🧠 **Overview**

This project focuses on identifying, analyzing, and removing **suspicious browser extensions** to strengthen online security.
Browser extensions, while useful, can become major security risks — they can track data, inject ads, or even steal credentials.
Through this task, I conducted a **hands-on audit**, removed unsafe add-ons, and documented key learnings about safe browser practices.


## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Inspect all installed browser extensions.
* Identify and remove suspicious or unnecessary ones.
* Understand how malicious extensions compromise privacy.
* Learn and apply best practices for secure browsing.

## 🧭 **Procedure**

### 🔹 Step 1 — Accessing Extension Manager

Opened the browser extension settings using the command:

```
chrome://extensions/
```

Viewed all active and inactive extensions.

### 🔹 Step 2 — Identifying Suspicious Extensions

Reviewed each extension and flagged those showing:

* Unknown origin or vague functionality.
* Excessive permissions (like “Read and change all your data on websites”).
* Unusual names or poor user ratings.
* Recently installed without consent.


### 🔹 Step 3 — Removal and Cleanup

Used Chrome’s **“Remove”** button to delete unnecessary or untrusted extensions.
Verified removal by refreshing the extensions page.


## 🧩 **Research: Common Extension Threats**

| Threat Type                  | Description                                             | Example Impact               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Adware**                   | Injects unwanted ads or redirects to malicious sites.   | Browser slowdown, popups.    |
| **Spyware**                  | Collects browsing history, passwords, or personal info. | Identity theft.              |
| **Crypto-mining extensions** | Secretly use your CPU for mining cryptocurrency.        | System overheating, lag.     |
| **Hijackers**                | Change browser homepages or search engines.             | Redirects to phishing pages. |


## 🔐 **Best Practices for Browser Security**

1. **Install only from official sources** (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons).
2. **Check developer credibility** and read reviews before installing.
3. **Review permissions** — don’t install extensions that ask for “access to all sites.”
4. **Update regularly** — outdated extensions can be exploited.
5. **Use antivirus software** with browser protection features.
6. **Limit extensions** — fewer add-ons mean fewer attack surfaces.
7. **Remove unused extensions** monthly as a hygiene practice.

## 🧠 **Key Learnings**

* Even legitimate-looking extensions can be malicious if permissions are abused.
* Regular auditing prevents hidden spyware and trackers from collecting user data.
* Removing unused extensions improves both **browser performance** and **system security**.
* Awareness and minimalism are the best defense — only install what’s essential.
